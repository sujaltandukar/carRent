  utter_bugatti_1:
  - text: Leave it to Bugatti to dethrone Rolls-Royce. The one-of-a-kind La Voiture
      Noire unveiled at the 2019 Geneva Auto Show stands proud as the most expensive
      new car ever built. The French automaker hasn’t revealed how much it charged
      for the one-off, Chiron-based model, though rumors point to a price tag in the
      vicinity of $19 million. We don’t even know who bought it. Some say it belongs
      to former Volkswagen Group boss Ferdinand Piëch; others believe soccer star
      Cristiano Ronaldo added it to his collection.
    image: 'media/pics/1.jpg '
  utter_bugatti_2:
  - text: Bugatti took everyone by surprise when it introduced a one-of-a-kind, $19
      million supercar named La Voiture Noire at the 2019 Geneva Auto Show. We didn’t
      know it at the time, but the French company was already working on its next
      masterpiece. The limited-edition, Chiron-based Centodieci is a tribute to the
      EB110 that lined every car-crazed kid’s bedroom wall during the 1990s. It’s
      a bargain at $8.9 million, at least compared to the La Voiture Noire. The Centodieci
      (a name that means one hundred and ten in Italian) wears a more angular design
      than other members of the Bugatti range. The emblem is positioned above the
      horseshoe-shaped grille, like it was on the EB110, and five round slots behind
      each side window create an additional visual link between the two cars. The
      interior is a lot like the Chiron’s, though it gets model-specific trim pieces,
      materials, and accents.

  utter_lambo_1:
  - text: Poison. That’s the name Lamborghini chose for the modified Aventador roadster
      you see above — translated from Italian,of course — built to celebrate the automaker’s
      50th birthday. We can’t speak for the company’s motivations, but the name is
      fitting for a vehicle that looks so positively deadly, so undeniably venomous.
      The car is absolutely stunning from every angle, and to this day, we’re not
      convinced it isn’t an alien spacecraft surveying our planet for eventual takeover.
      It just doesn’t seem real. The only thing more remarkable than the look is the
      price — a whopping $4.5 million, clearly putting it on our list of the most
      expensive cars.

  utter_lambo_2:
  - text: The Sian is not an ordinary Lamborghini. Limited to 63 units worldwide,
      it’s the company’s first production hybrid model. And, it’s not an ordinary
      hybrid, either. The electric motor is a 48-volt unit stuffed between the engine
      and the transmission, and it draws power from a supercapacitor instead of a
      more common lithium-ion battery pack. Lamborghini already showcased this technology
      in the Terzo Millennio concept unveiled in 2017; it’s a device that charges
      as quickly as it discharges, so it provides an intense power burst for a short
      amount of time.

  utter_rolls_1:
  - text: Rolls-Royce will build you anything if you have a thick enough wallet to
      pay for it. Take the Sweptail, for example. It’s a one-off coupe that a customer
      commissioned from the ground up. Its design draws inspiration from the brand’s
      classic models while borrowing styling cues from the world of super-yachts.
      Nearly every part of this car is unique, and the project took four years from
      start to finish, which explains why it cost approximately $13 million.

  utter_mercs_1:
  - text: While not the most expensive car on our list, the Maybach Exelero makes
      its appearance under Honorable Mentions due to its one-off status. The Maybach
      was also built way back in 2004, but that actually makes its sticker price more
      impressive. Adjusted for inflation, the Exelero would cost around $10.1 million
      in the United States today, which is close to the GDP of a small island nation.
      Money and Maybach are about as closely related as peanut butter and jelly, but
      the two-door further justifies its cost with a 700hp, twin-turbo V12 and luxurious
      amenities.
